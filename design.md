# Aesthetics

* Common things should have short names (eg. `Fn` rather than `lambda`)
* Discouraged things should have long names (eg. `evaluate` rather than `eval`)
* Macros are capitalised
* Clear names are better than traditional names (eg. `first` over `car`)
* No commas between params

# Other choices

* No nulls, instead people should use specific values that are descriptive of the individual case.

# Functions

* `If` is our name for `cond`
* `Name` is our name for `label`
* `Quote`
* `Fn` is our name for `lambda`

* `eq?`

* `atom?`

* `first` is our name for `car`
* `rest` is our name for `cdr`
* `pair` is our name for `cons`

* `evaluate` is not abreviated because you shouldn't use it much.
* `apply`
